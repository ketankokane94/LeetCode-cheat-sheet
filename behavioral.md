* Show, Don't tell:
> Difference between a good and a great answer, comes down to showing rather than telling.

1. Sprinkle in specific details
> Don't skimp on the details, Look out for opportunities to use specifics, especially if they're at all quirky, funny, suprisinging or otherwise memorable.

2. Tell a story from your life
3. Use someone else's voice
> lightly detailed story is better suited to show strength.

Practice, Practice and Practice

## STAR

4. Result

### You should have atleast one:
1. Eg of interesting problem you solved
2. Eg of Interpersonal conflict you overcame
3. Eg of Leadership or ownership

5. Piece of trivia about your favaorite language and something you don't like about said language.
6. Questions about companies product/business
7. Questions about the companies engineering strategy(testing, scrum, Development methodology)
8. Nerd out about stuff, Show you're proud of what you've done, you're amped about what they're doing and you have questions

# Behavioral
* Challenges faced
* About me
>Software engineer with an interest in application development, big data analytics, and machine learning. Currently pursuing Masters in computer science at Rochester Institute of Technology. 

>Previously worked with a fintech for 2 years as a Full-stack developer, working with Angular, C#, MVC .NET, MsSQL following agile methodology, and Test-Driven Development. Played versatile roles in the team ranging from managing release content to ensure proper burndown, acted as a consulting alias from the developer team to the support team for high priority production issues, and experience of communicating efficiently with the required shareholders regarding various statuses. All while managing everyday development activity.

>My strengths are to connect dots between two complex ideas, reading between the lines. a passion for coming up solutions without reinventing the wheel to reduce the repetitive work and innate ability to grasp new technologies/concepts very quickly.
* Impact of my project

* what cool technologies or algorithms have you used:
> 

* what is unique and different that people could learn from you?
> I am a strong believer of DRY principle, so I always find a way to avoid reinventing the wheel by hacking the process, but if given a challenge of building something custom I can rollup my sleeves and go for it. 

* What are you currently working on 


* You are in charge of a project and the time is limited, how would you manage to deliver results and set expectations?
> from an engineering point of view, I would do something like poker sizing, with aim to break down the entire result into sub-results and estimate each task and come up with a realistic goal of how much can be delivered within the given time frame.

* Follow up: Given more engineering resources how would you handle the same situation?


What do I need to convey?
* Are you a good team player? :
> can manage chaos, can step up to challenge. 
Can motivate team player, sometimes its just about motivating people.

## automation tools I have worked on: 
* scheduler-Automation
* chrome extension-Saw a gap and fixed it
* Information gathering using slack bot-Efficiency
> Avoid reinventing tools, search for the already existing. 
I like things to be automated, I don't enjoy doing the same thing again and again.

## My strengths:
* Connecting the points across multiple complex ideas.
* I am excellent at hacking the process. 
* good at motivating people around me in achieving a common goal.
* I can be decisive.
* I am geek by nature.
* Ability to articulate effectively technical challengess & solutions


## Weakness: 
* Talking a step back 
* I am not scared to be decisive, to say No, which I have seen is perceived as rude sometimes.

## Resume walk through
Know what soap is what rest is, how did I implement cache 

Why the project is there on the resume, 
As they are more interested in Java they might focus on bit torrent project. 
Learned about streamReader writer reader and writer. 

Talk as much as possible in terms of java. 
Have simple definition of fancy java terms. 


## Questions to ask to the interviewer:
* More about the team?
* How old is the project?
* I see that job uses DDD, is that something the team uses heavily. 
* Can you tell me few tools the team uses? Just to sense of the working environment. 
* What's the release cycle like for the project. 
* Does the team follow agile methodology?
* What's the internship program like?
* How many interns?
* Can you share more about the day-to-day responsibilities of this position? What’s a typical day like?
* What are your favorite and least favorite parts of the job?
* Why did you decide to join Company X?
* Can you tell me about the opportunities for career advancement at Company X?


## Description of each project:

* Automatic Scheduler:
> I am a man of routine, who is also a sort of geek in nature, on waking up every morning, I use google calendar to schedule my entire day, so I know at what time I would be doing what activity. I decide to write a tool which interacted with google calendar and google tasks API and using some complex scheduling algorithm figures out a daily schedule for me and pushes it back to the google calendar for  me to access.
