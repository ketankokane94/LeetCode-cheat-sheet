* Show, Don't tell:
> Difference between a good and a great answer, comes down to showing rather than telling.

1. Sprinkle in specific details
> Don't skimp on the details, Look out for opportunities to use specifics, especially if they're at all quirky, funny, suprisinging or otherwise memorable.

2. Tell a story from your life
3. Use someone else's voice
> lightly detailed story is better suited to show strength.

## Description of each project:

* Automatic Scheduler:
> I am a man of routine, who is also a sort of geek in nature, on waking up every morning, I use google calendar to schedule my entire day, so I know at what time I would be doing what activity. I decide to write a tool which interacted with google calendar and google tasks API and using some complex scheduling algorithm figures out a daily schedule for me and pushes it back to the google calendar for  me to access.
